# Java-SOAP
A toy shop stock control web service  

#### A third year college project :mortar_board: :three:

> This is a project to build a SOAP web service using java technologies.  
> The SOAP service implements basic CRUD activities on a simple ArrayList  
> structure to act as a database for the shop merchandise.  

The project was developed on eclipse Mars EE and a glassfish server.

The client uses jsp(Java Server Pages). The methods to interact with the service  
were created with the java _'wsimport'_ tool.

The directories included in this repo:  
* ToyStoreGFish: The eclipse project directory for the client app.  
* ToyStoreService: The eclipse project directory for the web service.  
* WAR: The web archive files for both of the above.  
* Images: Some screenshots of the client.
